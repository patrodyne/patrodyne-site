		<h1>Install a Simple Swing Application</h1>

		<p><b>On the surface</b>, this project builds a application to display
		a simple salutation. As such, the application can be used as a starting
		point for any Swing project. It uses one class to launch the
		application and another to start the GUI. The launcher limits its
		imports to the standard classloader but the GUI or other classes may
		use packages loaded by the Java Extension Mechanism. In the event that
		the extension path is not present, the launcher can catch the exception
		and display a message dialog.</p>
		
		<p><b>Under the surface</b>, this project is actually about creating an
		<em>IzPack</em> installer for this or any project.</p>
